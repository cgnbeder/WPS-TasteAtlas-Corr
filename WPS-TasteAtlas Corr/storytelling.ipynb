{"cells":[{"source":"# Correlation Between Women's Rights Indexes and Countries' Cuisine Rankings\n\nIn this project, I’m going to explore the correlation between a country's women's rights index and its ranking in world cuisine, according to TasteAtlas data.\n\nThe inspiration for this project comes from a stand-up show by comedian Andrew Schulz, where he humorously suggests that the culinary qualities of countries are inversely proportional to their women's rights index. You can watch the related stand-up show here: [Andrew Schulz Stand-up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHnfbGyoa6o). While the topic may be perceived as sensitive, my goal is to use it as a learning exercise in data analysis.\n\n**_Goal and Hypothesis_**\n\nThe goal of this project is to see if there's any truth to the hypothesis that countries with higher women's rights indexes have worse food rankings. This hypothesis, though controversial, provides an interesting angle for data analysis.\n\n**_Analysis Plan_**\n\nBefore researching the correlation between women's rights indexes and countries' cuisine rankings, I want to look at the women's rights index and read the data logically for pre-search. Correlation will be the final topic. The analysis will be structured as follows:\n- Assessment of the status and progress of women's rights by country.\n- Checking the cuisine rankings of these countries.\n- Seeing if there's any correlation between women's rights and countries' food rankings.\n\n**_A Quick Note_**\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, this project may be sensitive to some readers. My intention is not to make any insinuations or humiliate anyone. We live in a world where every event and phenomenon has positive and negative consequences, and I wanted to explore a side of this negative situation that can be positive. Although I am absolutely against violence against women and sexual discrimination, I believe that such walls have also been demolished today. However, this was not the case until approximately 20 years ago, and therefore this negative situation may have partially caused a positive result, as it is also mentioned in the stand-up show. Let's look at this together. Thanks for understanding!","metadata":{},"id":"6d613b6b-5db8-4ad0-80ce-f8476e04b59f","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"It is not easy to find data on the ratings of countries' cuisines and people's preferences through surveys. In addition, the data I have found also includes the preferences of a very specific geography, since they are collected in certain regions. For this reason, I consider it right to use the TasteAtlas ranking system. But first, I need to explain how TasteAtlas decides those rankings.\n\nRegarding this question, TasteAtlas made an announcement about how they rank countries by their cuisine. In summary, they said, \"The methodology of TasteAtlas is seemingly simple. Visitors vote, and we tally the votes and publish the rankings. Our key mechanism is a system we developed that differentiates genuine from invalid votes.\" You can find the full explanation and the reason for the announcement at this link: [TasteAtlas Methodology](https://www.tasteatlas.com/the-largest-french-television-accused-tasteatlas-of-rigging-the-cheese-ranking-in-favor-of-italy#:~:text=The%20methodology%20of%20TasteAtlas%20is,differentiates%20genuine%20from%20invalid%20votes.)\n\nFor the reasons that can be understood from the description, TasteAtlas ratings have a more global perspective. Instead of using surveys such as people's preferences conducted only in the United States or Europe, I think it would be more accurate to use TasteAtlas, which receives its data from a broader audience.","metadata":{},"id":"f685c582-759a-4120-bd18-ea4dae7bf1bd","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"![23-24 TasteAtlas](Plots/23-24%20TasteAtlas.jpg)","metadata":{},"id":"f82fe8a9-22e0-4dd9-a311-bec60f601597","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"Let's keep the TasteAtlas data above. Now, let's look at women's rights in general and understand how indexes are calculated.\n\nWe have two different datasets for the women's rights index by country. One of them is from the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security (GIWPS), which is more detailed. The other one is the Women's Civil Rights Index from Our World in Data (Source: V-DEM). You can find more information at these links: [GIWPS](https://giwps.georgetown.edu/the-index/) and [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/women-civil-liberties-index?tab=table).\n\nIn this research, I'm going to use the GIWPS index as my main data source because it's more detailed and also more updated. The Our World In Data (V-DEM) data provides an estimate as an average. On the other hand, the WPS index includes a summary of this data and uses it to create many documents and plots. You can check that summary if you're interested [here](https://giwps.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WPS-Index-executive-summary.pdf).

To avoid this potential misinterpretation, I will categorize countries by their indexes and conduct my research based on these categories, rather than examining countries individually.

The Silk Road was a major trade network that connected the East and West, facilitating not only the exchange of goods like spices, silk, and ceramics but also culinary practices, techniques, and ingredients. As traders, travelers, and settlers moved along the Silk Road, they brought with them their food culture, which blended with local traditions and created diverse and rich culinary practices in the regions along the route. For example, countries like Italy, China, Turkey, and Iran, which were significant stops on the Silk Road, today boast some of the world's most highly rated cuisines according to TasteAtlas. The migration of ingredients such as spices from Asia to Europe and cooking methods shared across these regions contributed to the development of distinctive yet interconnected cuisines. This historical exchange might explain why many countries along the Silk Road now have globally recognized and highly appreciated food cultures. By examining these connections, we can see how trade and cultural interaction have directly influenced the culinary excellence observed today.\n\nDuring the colonization era, European settlers brought their cultural practices, lifestyles, and, most notably, their culinary traditions with them to the Americas. Italian, Spanish, French, and British immigrants transferred their home cuisines across the Atlantic, where they adapted to local ingredients and created new culinary blends. For example, Italian dishes like pasta and pizza evolved in America and became staples of American culture. Similarly, in Latin America, we see the strong influence of Spanish and Portuguese cuisines. The Mediterranean diet, with its emphasis on olive oil, vegetables, and grains, also found its place in the New World through these migration patterns. The Americas thus became a melting pot of immigrant food cultures. Consequently, the European culinary influences—many of which trace back to the Silk Road—formed a key foundation for the rich and diverse food landscape seen in the Americas today.\n\n**Insights on Categorization and p-Value Interpretation:**\n\nWhen working with different categorization methods (7, 4, and 3 categories), the results varied in their significance. In cases where the p-value was close to the threshold (e.g., 0.06), it suggests that while the relationship is not strictly statistically significant, there could be a weak correlation that might be better captured with refined methods or more data. In statistical analysis, when the p-value is near 0.05, it is crucial to explore potential underlying factors or consider adjustments in categorization, as done here, to better understand these subtle connections.\n\nUltimately, simplifying the categorization to 3 groups revealed a trend closer to significance, which could indicate an underlying pattern, though it remains weak.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"98ce99a0-da19-4842-9c95-17430676d844"},{"source":"# 3.
